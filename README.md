👋 Hi there, I'm @chirag-v!

🚀 Passionate Developer: Specializing in Python and Point of Sale (POS) systems with a focus on the pharmaceutical sector.

🔍 Current Focus: I’m working on OpenRxERP, a Django-based POS system designed for the Indian pharmacy retail market. While the project’s website openrxerp.com currently hosts our documentation, we're in the exciting stages of development and ready for contributions!

🤝 Let’s Collaborate: I’m on the lookout for like-minded collaborators to help bring OpenRxERP to life. If you’re a developer, designer, or someone with valuable insights into pharmacy operations, I’d love to connect and explore how we can work together.

📬 Get in Touch: Reach out to me at chirag740@gmail.com. I’m eager to discuss potential collaborations, share ideas, and build something impactful together.

🌟 Stay Tuned: Keep an eye on our documentation at https://openrxerp.com and updates for the latest progress!
